     Version Notes 
    </h1>

    <h2>Version 0.2</h2>
   
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Contains skater data (goalies not included) from NHL players from 2017-2020</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Known Issues</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Does not check for name uniqueness (searching "Sebastian Aho" will return the combined results of both Sebastian Ahos)</li>
        <li>Trade information is incomplete. The exact trade dates are missing, so two players may erroneously appear as teammates or not if they were traded in the same year to/from the same team. Team information for players that were traded multiple times in one year is incomplete.</li>
        <li>Skaters full names must be entered exactly as they appear on <a href="https://eliteprospects.com">EliteProspects</a>, including accents (for example, "Nicklas Bäckström" will return results but "Nicklas Backstrom" will not).</li>
    </ul>
